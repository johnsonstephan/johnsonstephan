# Smart Contract Security Researcher Portfolio

Hi there, I'm Stephan. I am currently completing the [Secureum Bootcamp](https://www.secureum.xyz/epoch0). I recently completed my [MSc in Blockchain and Digital Currency](https://www.unic.ac.cy/blockchain/msc-digital-currency/) at the University of Nicosia as a [Coinbase Scholar](https://www.unic.ac.cy/unic-and-coinbase-announce-awardees-of-their-scholarship-programme-for-minority-professionals/#:~:text=I%20chose%20to%20apply%20to%20the,accessibility%20of%20financial%20services). Following the bootcamp, I intend to begin bug hunting on Code4rena, Sherlock, and Immunefi.

Below, you will find a portfolio of my learning journey and accomplishments in smart contract development & auditing.
