### Smart Contracts

[Here](https://github.com/johnsonstephan/smart-contract-security-researcher-portfolio/tree/main/smart-contracts) are various smart contracts I've developed, including:

- [NFT Marketplace: OpenWave](https://github.com/johnsonstephan/smart-contract-security-researcher-portfolio/tree/main/smart-contracts/erc721/custom-erc721-marketplace)
- [Custom NFT ERC721 Token](https://github.com/johnsonstephan/smart-contract-security-researcher-portfolio/tree/main/smart-contracts/erc721/custom-nft-erc721-token)
- [Custom ERC20 Token](https://github.com/johnsonstephan/smart-contract-security-researcher-portfolio/tree/main/smart-contracts/erc20/custom-erc20-token)
- [Token Depository and Receipt Token](https://github.com/johnsonstephan/smart-contract-security-researcher-portfolio/tree/main/smart-contracts/erc20/token-depository-and-receipt-token)

### Vulnerabilities and Safeguards

[Here](https://github.com/johnsonstephan/smart-contract-security-researcher-portfolio/tree/main/vulnerabilities-and-safeguards) is a compilation of projects that underline common vulnerabilities and exhibit how they can be exploited. For some, improved contracts are included, showcasing best practices to fortify the contract's security. Highlights include:

- [Formal Verification Overflow](https://github.com/johnsonstephan/smart-contract-security-researcher-portfolio/tree/main/vulnerabilities-and-safeguards/arithmetic-wraparounds/formal-verification-overflow)
- [CryptoBank Reentrancy](https://github.com/johnsonstephan/smart-contract-security-researcher-portfolio/tree/main/vulnerabilities-and-safeguards/reentrancy/cryptobank-reentrancy)
- [TX Origin Phishing](https://github.com/johnsonstephan/smart-contract-security-researcher-portfolio/tree/main/vulnerabilities-and-safeguards/phishing/tx-origin-phishing)
- [Token Minting Underflow](https://github.com/johnsonstephan/smart-contract-security-researcher-portfolio/tree/main/vulnerabilities-and-safeguards/arithmetic-wraparounds/token-minting-underflow)
- [ICO Overflow](https://github.com/johnsonstephan/smart-contract-security-researcher-portfolio/tree/main/vulnerabilities-and-safeguards/arithmetic-wraparounds/ico-overflow)
- [Beyond The Limit Overflow](https://github.com/johnsonstephan/smart-contract-security-researcher-portfolio/tree/main/vulnerabilities-and-safeguards/arithmetic-wraparounds/beyond-the-limit-overflow)
- [Timed Vault Overflow](https://github.com/johnsonstephan/smart-contract-security-researcher-portfolio/tree/main/vulnerabilities-and-safeguards/arithmetic-wraparounds/timed-vault-overflow)
- [Insecure Blockhash](https://github.com/johnsonstephan/smart-contract-security-researcher-portfolio/tree/main/vulnerabilities-and-safeguards/insecure-randomness/randomness-blockhash)
- [Guessing Random Numbers](https://github.com/johnsonstephan/smart-contract-security-researcher-portfolio/tree/main/vulnerabilities-and-safeguards/insecure-randomness/randomness-guessing)

### Wargames

[Here](https://github.com/johnsonstephan/smart-contract-security-researcher-portfolio/tree/main/wargames) are my solutions to blockchain security wargames, challenges, and capture the flag (CTF) competitions.
