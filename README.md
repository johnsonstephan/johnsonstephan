# Smart Contract Security Researcher Portfolio

Hi there, I'm Stephan. I am currently completing the [Secureum Bootcamp](https://www.secureum.xyz/epoch0). I recently completed my [MSc in Blockchain and Digital Currency](https://www.unic.ac.cy/blockchain/msc-digital-currency/) at the University of Nicosia as a [Coinbase Scholar](https://www.unic.ac.cy/unic-and-coinbase-announce-awardees-of-their-scholarship-programme-for-minority-professionals/#:~:text=I%20chose%20to%20apply%20to%20the,accessibility%20of%20financial%20services). Following the bootcamp, I intend to begin bug hunting on Code4rena, Sherlock, and Immunefi.

Below, you will find a portfolio of my learning journey and accomplishments in smart contract development & auditing.

### Smart Contracts

Here, you can explore various smart contracts (including Hardhat tests) I've developed during my learning journey, including:

- [NFT Marketplace: OpenWave](https://github.com/johnsonstephan/smart-contract-security-researcher-portfolio/tree/main/smart-contracts/erc721/custom-erc721-marketplace)
- [Custom NFT ERC721 Token](https://github.com/johnsonstephan/smart-contract-security-researcher-portfolio/tree/main/smart-contracts/erc721/custom-nft-erc721-token)
- [Custom ERC20 Token](https://github.com/johnsonstephan/smart-contract-security-researcher-portfolio/tree/main/smart-contracts/erc20/custom-erc20-token)
- [Token Depository and Receipt Token](https://github.com/johnsonstephan/smart-contract-security-researcher-portfolio/tree/main/smart-contracts/erc20/token-depository-and-receipt-token)

Each smart contract folder contains the contract code (`.sol`) and their corresponding tests (`.js`).

### Vulnerabilities and Safeguards

Here is a compilation of projects that underline common vulnerabilities and exhibit how they can be exploited. For some, resolution methods and improved contract versions are included, showcasing best practices to fortify the contract's security.

Highlights include:

- [Guessing Random Numbers](https://github.com/johnsonstephan/smart-contract-security-researcher-portfolio/tree/main/vulnerabilities-and-safeguards/insecure-randomness/randomness-guessing)

### Wargames

Here are my solutions to blockchain security wargames, challenges, and capture the flag (CTF) competitions.
